        <p>Brief: The first paragraph is an overview about what you should look for in the zine, and something that will tell you what to look out for according to your interests. The second paragraph focuses on dates that take little planning, money, and time, you can kind of just go into them and go out. The third paragraph handles dates that may require more resources, but also require more commitment. It also concludes slightly.
          If you’re a college student looking to take someone on that date you probably won’t have that cash to head to a Broadway show or hit the bar for something that may not amount to anything at all. And even if you did, you shouldn’t. Unless your rich, in that case fork it over! Otherwise, places like the High Line, Chelsea Market, and free comedy nights like St. Mark’s and The Knitting Club’s are always nice. If you’re willing to spend more than just a couple bites to eat, such as parks that would require admission fees, the botanical gardens in both the Bronx and Brooklyn would make great sights to see. My personal choice would be going out for brunch, nothing has beaten a better first date in NY than Bubby’s or Clinton East.
	        The High Line is clean, has a great view, and is perfect at nearly any time of the day. At night there are usually stargazing activities that you can join in and there are a ton of cheap snacks along the path like gelato, lattes and ice cream. Nothing though beats the Bagel and Coffee Company that is just a little walk away and right next to the station you’d probably use to get there. They put all other bagels and brunch places to shame with a wide selection of contents from smoked salmon with avocado, fruits and veggies with honey sauce to something as place as cream cheese and toasted. Chelsea Market has some of the best brownies you’ll ever taste and goat milk ice cream which you and your date has likely never tried before. There are tons of food options to explore there and if you don’t want any then there’s some nice views to check out just a walk away by the Brooklyn Bridge. The comedy clubs, when free, are always nice to go to, especially since the one on St. Marks has half a dozen places to grab a quick drink alcoholic or not, Copper and Oak, Upstate, Mango mango, Spot, and Kung Fu Tea just to name a few. And that doesn’t include the great ramen places either.
	        The Botanical Gardens give you and your date something to comment on, if your not so great with making conversation this will probably be your thing. Maybe study up on flowers beforehand too, if you really want to impress. The food in the botanical gardens is mediocre, but outside are some decent places to grab a snack like tacos or sandwiches, which really fit the whole “flowery stroll thing” anyways. As for places to get brunch, in NY there are so many, I’ve already listed two or three of them. But for me, nothing has beaten the casual but serene setting Bubby’s, Clinton East, and Mom’s Kitchen and Bar. Unlike the other places for dates though, this one may be tougher simply because there’s nothing to comment on. But for me it works, and that’s the most important part of picking from these choices, finding the one that you’re comfortable with. (Warning: Bubby’s pancakes could sink an iceberg)</p>
